Latest Updates:
1) Parsed and created objects containing numbers. Need to push these numbers into nested arrays.
2) Added /newSurveys (myCharts.html)


d3.js
1) Clean up graphs

Ideas:
1. Random Button which will pull a random survey

Static
1. Currently Basic. Will style towards end. Do not take short cuts on the full stack projects. Make it look nice.
2. I'm not happy with the current look. The end product must look competitive.


Graphs:
1. Use d3 (maybe d3 with react?)
2. Parse cookie data in order to get info for graphs. Must keep in mind that unauthenticated users must be able to view graph so must find a way to display(perhaps with url? :/str)
3. Must ensure that there is only one vote per IP address.
