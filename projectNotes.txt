Ideas:
1. Random Button which will pull a random survey

Static
1. Currently Basic. Will style towards end. Do not take short cuts on the full stack projects. Make it look nice.
2. I'm not happy with the current look. The end product must look competitive.

User Authen
1. Using Cookies to communicate with pages. It'll be a pain in the ass, but its really just a matter of parsing.
2. Edit password needs to check for current password.

Graphs:
1. Use d3 (maybe d3 with react?)
2. Parse cookie data in order to get info for graphs. Must keep in mind that unauthenticated users must be able to view graph so must find a way to display(perhaps with url? :/str)
3. Must ensure that there is only one vote per IP address.

Latest Updates: 
1. Successfully stored survey data in cookies..Json stringify to simplify code going into cookies, once pulled in JS was able to store in local storage.
2. Updated from array to Object for chart data in order to adjust to polling. Need to relook at cookies and parsing.
